# RPS-Multiplayer
This project is built for those who are tired of the old rock papper sissors and want a extended version of the game.

Behold! The Rock Papper Sissor Lizard Spock!
It is invented in the big bang theory, as a upgraded version of rock papper sissors. Or as Sheldon explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

Have fun!
